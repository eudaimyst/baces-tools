# BACES Tools

BACES Tools is a personal project I created as a learning exercise in implementing YOLO. Although it began as a tool for my own use, Iâ€™ve decided to share it with the community.

The project is powered by:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)  
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)  
- [fast-sort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-sort)  
- [Amazon Q](https://aws.amazon.com/q/)  
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)

While I recognize that the current implementation might not meet professional standards, itâ€™s been an invaluable learning experience. Web development is challenging, and I acknowledge Iâ€™m still growing in this space.

I may revisit and expand this project if the game it supports releases without a similar tool. I believe deckbuilding deserves more attention. Itâ€™s such a fun and strategic element that could be significantly enhanced with better tools and integration.

A big thank you to Uncapped Games ðŸ¦€ for the fantastic game!
